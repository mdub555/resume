      We worked through the entire process of creating an Android application from
      scratch using proper design with application fragments and activities. Our
      app is a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet which allows the user to
      keep track of their players stats. I focused on the dice-roller that the
      player can use to roll realistic-looking dice using OpenGL ES.\@

  %     We spent three weeks developing and coding a LISP program that takes in
  %     input, potentially a regular expression, and converts it to a Discrete
  %     Event System and which can then be solved with a route through the
  %     Discrete Event System using graph traversal methods.

      Lightning creates atmospheric events in the ionosphere, called Elves, that
      can be observed at the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina. I helped
      develop a set of modules to work with existing modules that take weighted
      photon position data from a simulation of an Elve and simulate what that
      would look like in the detectors at the observatory.
