      We spent three weeks developing and coding a LISP program that takes in input, potentially a
      regular expression, and converts it to a Discrete Event System and which can then be solved
      with a route through the Discrete Event System using graph traversal methods.

%      We work through the entire process of creating an Android application from scratch using

      Lightning creates atmospheric events in the ionosphere, called Elves, that can be observed at
      the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina. I helped develop a set of modules to work with
      existing modules that take weighted photon position data from a simulation of an Elve and
      simulate what that would look like in the detectors at the observatory.

      Six week long session where we learn hands on skills such as working precision machinery in a
      shop, handling different types of vacuums, designing analog circuits, construction and
      operation of lasers, and how to program in several different languages.
