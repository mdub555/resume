      I was offered a scholarship for front-end web development that allows me to learn website
      development with JavaScript and HTML5. This challenge scholarship can lead to a longer course
      of the same subject.

    {
      In my spare time, I use the SFML library in C++ to build a clone of Asteroids from scratch.
      Most of the gameplay is implemented, but I'm still working on the menu and other systems. This
      project as it is can be found on my GitHub page under Corvus Praedo.
